# Objective and Introduction
The objective of this game is to get the best score you can by avoiding the red rectangles (obstacles). Every obstacle missed is a one point increase in score. Try your best to not hit the obstacles! Try beating your previous score!

# Controls

Use the arrow keys to move the player (the ball). Use the left arrow key to move left, use the right arrow key to move right, use the up arrow key to move up, and use the down arrow key to move down. If you unfortunately hit an obstacle, you can click space to restart, however this will also reset your score to 0. Try not to get hit!
